Section 4.2.2. More of Idris amazing code synthesis abilities vs Haskell
========================================================================

Idris code example
------------------  
|IdrisRef: Sec4_2_2.idr   

Idris wrote all this code after some case splits.  

Compared to Haskell
-------------------

> module Part2.Sec4_2_2 where
